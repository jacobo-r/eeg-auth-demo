# EEG-Based Authentication Framework Demo

Welcome to the repository for the EEG-based authentication framework demo! This is just a base for building a more advanced user interface for EEG authentication.

## Repository Structure

- `notebook`: Contains a system test of the EEG authentication framework.
- `trained`: Houses the pre-trained machine learning model.
- `util`: Contains additional functions required to execute the code.
- `Model`: Source code where the authentication model is defined.

## Getting Started

### 1. Dataset Preparation

Before you begin, ensure you have downloaded the required dataset. You can find the link for the dataset within the notebook. Once downloaded, create a `data` folder in the root directory of this repository and store the dataset there.

### 2. Installation

The code was run using the following versions of the software and libraries:

- Python: `3.9.6`
- PyTorch: `1.9.0`
